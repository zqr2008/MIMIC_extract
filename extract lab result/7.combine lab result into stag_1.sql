-- The aim of this query is to join above six query into 1(name stag_1) for future use.
-- The query is based on : 1.first GCS in ICU.sql
--                         2.first vital signs in ICU.sql
--                         3.first complete blood count in ICU.sql
--                         4.first chemistry in ICU.sql
--                         5.first blood gas in ICU.sql
--                         6.first enzyme in ICU.sql
-- All six queries can be found at https://github.com/zqr2008/mimic-database-vaildation/tree/main/extract%20lab%20result
-- (creatinine*88.4) to obtain creatinine in 'Î¼mol/L'
-- (bun/2.80) to obtain bun in 'mmol/L',
-- (glucose/18) to obtain glucose in 'mmol/L',
-- (hemoglobin*10) to obtain hemoglobin in 'g/L'
-- (bilirubin_total*17.1) to obtain bilirubin_total in 'umol/L'
-- (heart_rate/sbp) to obtain shock index
